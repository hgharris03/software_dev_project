Check out the app here: https://us-vehicle-ads.onrender.com

The data for the app was pulled from vehicles_us.csv, it contains information about advertisements for cars on sale. 
The objective is to screen through the ads with this user friendly app. The behind the scenes code is Python and run with streamlit. 

The first choice is to include new cars or not. Simply check the box to add new cars to the list. 
From there are two dropdown menus to filter the car model and condition. 
There is a slider to further filter down based on days listed for sale. 

The next feature is the histogram that allows you to see the price distribution based on automobile condition, transmission, type, or paint color. 
The last feature is a scatter plot designed to quickly see how price is affected by odometer, transmission type, or number of cylinders. 

Happy car hunting!
